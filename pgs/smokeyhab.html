        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is my go to for making an enjoyable hotsauce that will blow any local resturants out of the ball park on heat level while still being enjoyable for the average heat enjoyer.
            I do not recomend serving this sauce to people who are not known to enjoy spice. It will be hotter than anything they have tried before and they may cry.
        </p>
        <p>This sauce has a smokey habanero flavour, decent heat level, and is simple though a little time consuming to make.</p>
